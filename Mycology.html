      <h1>Mycology</h1>
      <h3>What is Mycology</h3>
      <p>Mycology is the study of fungi and slime molds, although slime molds are not fungi. Fungi include mould, yeast, toadstools, and mushrooms. Slime molds are soil-dwelling amoeba that often contain multiple nuclei.</p>
      <h3>Fungi</h3>
      <p>Fungi are eukaryotes, meaning they have a defined nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mould:</strong> Mould is a type of multicellular fungi composed of hyphae that intertwine to form mycelium. Hyphae are the feathery filaments that make up multicellular fungi. They release enzymes to absorb nutrients from a food source, and have a firm wall made of chitin (C8H13O5N), a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, an amide derivative of glucose. Mycelium is just a mass of filaments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Yeast:</strong> Yeasts are eukaryotic, unicellular organisms. It is often used in baking, to cause bread to "rise". The yeast feeds on the flour, releasing carbon dioxide, which gets trapped in tiny pockets in the bread. Yeast reproduce by budding, where a small "bud" forms on the parent cell, grows, and then separates to become a new cell.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Toadstools:</strong> Toadstools generally have a stalk and a cap, with gills or pores on the underside of the cap where spores are produced and released. These spores allow the fungi to reproduce and spread. Bright colors or unusual patterns seen on toadstools often signal toxicity, a warning not to consume them. Not all toadstools are toxic, some are just inedible. They also play essential roles in ecosystems as decomposers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mushrooms:</strong> Mushrooms have two main phyla, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. Similar to toadstools, they have a stalk and a cap with gills or pores on the underside of the cap where spores are produced and released. Some are poisonous, but others are edible. Mushrooms decompose organic matter and help plants absorb nutrients and water more efficiently.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Toadstools vs Mushrooms</h4>
      <p>In microbiology, toadstools and mushrooms both refer to the fruiting bodies of fungi, primarily in the Basidiomycota phylum, though these terms carry slightly different connotations based on tradition and toxicity.</p>

      <h3>Slime Molds</h3>
      <p>Slime molds are unicellular organisms often found in moist environments such as decaying wood, leaf litter, and soil. They are categorized into two types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plasmodial Slime Molds:</strong> These exist as a large, single-celled mass called plasmodium, which contains many nuclei. The plasmodium moves slowly, ingesting organic matter and helping decompose materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Cellular Slime Molds:</strong> These begin as individual amoeba-like cells, but aggregate to form a multicellular structure when resources are limited. The aggregate may form a stalk-like structure to release spores for reproduction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Slime molds have been used in research for studying behavior and cell development.</p>

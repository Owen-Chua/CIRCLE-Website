      <h1>The Basics of Microbiology</h1>
      <h3>What is Microbiology?</h3>
      <p>Microbiology is the study of microorganisms. <br><br>
        The Earth has approximately a trillion species of microorganisms. In the human body itself, there are about 39 trillion microbial cells, about 10,000 species. They are extremely diverse and adaptable, living in some of the harshest climates on the planet. Spores preserved in amber have been revived after 40 million years, and spores from salt deposits in New Mexico have been revived after 250 million years, making these bacteria by far the longest-living organisms ever recorded. <br><br>
        Studying these organisms could help better fight against diseases like cancer, and better understand them, and their possible uses. Examples include penicillin, the first antibiotic, which was discovered by Alexander Fleming by accident when he found mould growing on a Petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria. He noticed the mould seemed to be preventing the bacteria around it from growing. He soon identified that the mould produced a self-defence chemical that could kill bacteria.

      <h3>Types of Microorganisms and Importance</h3>
      <p>Microorganisms come in many shapes and sizes, each with unique structures and behaviors that allow them to thrive in diverse environments. Some of the major types include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bacteria: These are single-celled organisms with simple cell structures and can be found almost everywhere—from hot springs to the human gut. Bacteria play important roles in ecosystems as decomposers, and in industries like fermentation and bioremediation.</li>
        <li>Viruses: Unlike bacteria, viruses are not considered fully "alive" as they can’t reproduce without a host cell. Known for causing diseases like the flu, viruses are also being studied for potential use in gene therapy. Parts of viruses are used to create vaccines, with different types of vaccines using different parts to build up immunity in the body.</li>
        <li>Fungi: Fungi include molds, yeasts, and mushrooms, and they contribute to ecosystems by breaking down organic material. Yeasts, for example, are key to baking and brewing.</li>
        <li>Protozoa: These single-celled organisms often live in water or as parasites in other organisms. Some protozoa are harmless, while others can cause diseases like malaria.</li>
        <li>Algae: Algae are a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms, both unicellular and multicellular, like seaweed, also known as macroalgae. They can be useful, being used as biofuels, but an algae bloom can cause devastation to an ecosystem.</li>
        <li>Slime Molds: Often studied with fungi under mycology, slime molds are unicellular organisms, strange, blob-like organisms that usually live in moist places, like decaying wood or soil, and help with nutrient recycling and soil health.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Characterization of Microorganisms</h3>
      <p>There are 3 main groups of living things: Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. Bacteria and Archaea come from the superkingdom of Prokarya.</p>

      <h1>The Basics of Microbiology</h1>
      <h3>What is Microbiology?</h3>
      <p>Microbiology is the study of microorganisms.<br><br>
        The Earth has approximately a trillion species of microorganisms. In the human body itself, there are about 39 trillion microbial cells, about 10,000 species. They are extremely diverse and adaptable, living in some of the harshest climates on the planet. For example, a piece of amber had been found to contain some spores, that were revived after 40 million years. Even more incredibly, in New Mexico, some from salt deposits were revived after a whopping 250 million years. These bacteria are hence the longest-living organisms ever known.<br><br>
        Studying these organisms could help better fight against diseases like cancer, and better understand them, and their possible uses. For example, penicillin, the first antibiotic, discovered by Alexander Fleming by accident when he discovered mould growing on a Petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria. He noticed that it seemed to stop the bacteria around it from growing. He quickly discovered that it could produce a defensive chemical capable of killing bacteria.</p>
      <h3>Characterization of Microorganisms</h3>
      <p>There are 3 main groups of living things: Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. Bacteria and Archaea come from the superkingdom of Prokarya.</p>

      <h3>Diveristy of Microorganisms</h3>
      <p>Microorganisms come in many shapes and sizes, each with unique structures and behaviors that allow them to thrive in diverse environments. Some of the major types include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bacteria: These are single-celled organisms with simple cell structures and can be found almost everywhere—from hot springs to the human gut. Bacteria play important roles in ecosystems as decomposers, and in industries like fermentation and bioremediation.</li>
        <li>Viruses: Unlike bacteria, viruses are not considered fully "alive" as they can’t reproduce without a host cell. Known for causing diseases like the flu, viruses are also being studied for potential use in gene therapy. Parts of viruses are used to create vaccines, with different types of vaccines using different parts to build up immunity in the body.</li>
        <li>Fungi: Fungi include molds, yeasts, and mushrooms, and they contribute to ecosystems by breaking down organic material. Yeasts, for example, are key to baking and brewing.</li>
        <li>Protozoa: These single-celled organisms often live in water or as parasites in other organisms. Not all protozoa are harmful, some are even beneficial to us. </li>
        <li>Algae: Algae are a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms, both unicellular and multicellular, like seaweed, also known as macroalgae. They can be useful, being used as biofuels, but an algae bloom can cause devastation to an ecosystem.</li>
        <li>Slime Molds: Often studied with fungi under mycology, slime molds are unicellular organisms, strange, blob-like organisms that usually live in moist places, like decaying wood or soil, and help with nutrient recycling and soil health.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Basic Microbial Structure and Function </h3> <!--Include Nutrition, Growth, and Genetics in this section-->
      <h4>Cell Structures</h4>
      <ol>
        <strong><li>Prokaryotic Cell Structures</li></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Bacteria</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Cell Wall: It is located outside the cell membrane. It has an average thickness of ~15-30nm, and mainly consists of peptidoglycan. This is different from plants and fungi, which have cell walls made from cellulose and chitin respectively. Gram-positive bacteria have a glycan backbone, tetrapeptide side chains, and a pentapeptide cross-linking bridge, with a thicker cell wall, hence called monoderms. Gram-negative bacteria, on the other hand, lack the pentapeptide cross-linking bridges, but they do have direct links between tetrapeptide chains, with a thinner cell wall, but also possess lipopolysaccharides or lipoproteins forming an outer membrane surrounding the cell, hence called diderms. There are some bacteria that lack a cell wall.</li>
            <li>Cell Membrane: It is a selectively permeable membrane behind the cell wall that surrounds the cytoplasm, composed of lipid bilayer, like phopholipids, where the fatty acids are connected to the glycerol via ester linkages. In ester-linked lipids, fatty acid chains are connected to the glycerol backbone by an ester bond (-COO-). It forms between the carboxyl group (-COOH) of the fatty acid and the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the glycerol. The glycerol backbone in bacteria exist in the D-isomeric form, which is the configuration of the orientation of the hydroxyl groups on the glycerol molecule. This is important as the enzymes that synthesize bacterial phospholipids need to recognise this configuration to be able to correctly assemble the fluid and semi-permeable lipid bilayer, ensuring that there is the right molecular arrangement for bacterial membranes to be stable and functionable. Aside from phospholipids, triglycerides are also ester-linked lipids, demonstrating the C-O-C=O functional group that typically occurs in ester-linked lipids, although the ester link could also connect to other atoms, but usually occurs only synthetically. The phospholipids have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail that allows control over movement of substances in and out of the cell. This allows important functions to take place, such as nutrient uptake and waste removal. It is ~7.5nm thick. Additionally, the phosphate group is connected to the glycerol backbone by a phosphoester bond (C-O-P=O). This is important in forming the structure and contributes to the fluidity of the membrane. The linkage helps maintain the crucial amphipatic nature of the phospholipid, allowing for proper function, with the head facing outward, and the tail facing inward to create the stable barrier. It also resembles some of the eukaryotic cell membrane, except for the absence of cholestrol. Some bacteria use hopanoids to stabilise their membranes.</li>
            <li>Cytoplasm: It is a gel-like substance wrapped around by the cell membrane, made of water, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, etc. Most cellular activities take place in here. Many other cellular structures are also found here.</li>
            <li>Ribosomes: It is found in the cytoplasm and are ~15-20 nm in diameter. The ribosome is made up of a small and big subunit, 30S and 50S respectively (S stands for Svedburg Unit). The bacterial ribosomes are 70S, compared to eukaryotic ribosomes, which are 80S. Magnesium ions are needed to stabilise the reaction between the subunits, for them to form a functional ribosome. They are used to synthesize protein.</li>
            <li>Plasmids: It is a small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule, and is distinct from a cell's chromosomal DNA. They can replicate the bacterial chromosome independently; and often carry genes that give bacteria certain advantages, such as drug resistance, and can spread these traits making them more adaptable. They can spread these either via conjugation, which is direct connections between two bacteria, or transduction, where a virus/bacteriophage carries plasmid DNA by accident from on bacterium to another. Additionally, bacteria can take up free plasmid DNA from the environment. This process is known as transformation.</li>
            <li>Cytoplasmic inclusion granules: They are a form of storing nutrients such as carbon sources and compounds like sulfur and polyphosphate, inside the cytoplasm of the cell, but are not essential or permanent structures in bacterial cells. They also help with osmoregulation, the regulation of osmotic pressure of the bodily fluids, to maintain equilibrium with the water content, and metabolic flexability, adjusting the metabolic rate depending on the environmental factors. Some types have unique features, such as detoxification of potentially harmful compounds, magnetosomes, which are found in magnetotatic bacteria allowing the cells to align to the Earth's magnetic field for navigation, photosynthetic granules, found in cyanobacteria, where special inclusion granules have enzymes for carbon fixation, and gas vesicles, found in aquatic bacteria, allowing for control over buoyancy.</li>
            <li>Nucleoid: It is irregularly shaped, usually has a single circular chromosome, and stores most of the genetic material. The single circular chromosome has no free ends as the DNA is in a closed loop, different from eukaryotes which usually have linear chromosomes. The special shape of the chromosome means that it has no telomeres, which are the ends of the chromosomes. They can degrade over time, which can affect genetic material. The circular chromosomes ensure that DNA remains intact without the need for repair, and are also resistant to exomucleases, enzymes that degrade DNA from the ends, hence the shape increases its stability. It also has other benefits, such as efficient replication. Due to the lack of ends, there is no problem with replicating the ends of the DNA, and hence no problems with chromosomal shortening. Circular chromosomes can also undergo bidirectional replication, where they can have multiple origins of replication, which replicates from those points, making it quicker. Since the chromosmes are structurally similar to plasmids, it allows for easier integration of plasmids into the chromosome during horizontal gene transfer, allowing for the attainment of beneficial traits. The structure also allows for easier recombination events, making them more adaptable. It has a similar function to the nucleus in eukaryotic cells.</li>
            <li>Flagella: It is a tail-like structure that is attatched to the body of the cell. It allows for motility in motile bacteria. It is composed of the basal body, hook, and filament. It is possible for bacteria to have multiple flagella. Flagella can play a role in the pathogenesis of certain diseases and often exhibit antigenic properties.</li>
            <li>Pilus: It is a hair-like filament protruding from the surface of the bacterial cell, made of a protein called pilin. They are found mostly in gram-negative bacteria, but also some gram-positive bacteria. There are 3 types. Ordinary pilus or attatchment pilus, which are used to adhere to surfaces, and help to colonise during infections. Sex pilus are longer and fewer. They help in conjugation, where genetic material is transferred from one bacterium to another (by plasmids). This form of pilus forms a bridge between the bacteria for the exchange. Lastly, there are type IV pili, which help with twitching motility and adhesion and biofilm formation. Pili, especially sex pili, are often encoded by genes carried on plasmids.</li>
            <li>Capsule: It is a structured layer that adheres to the cell wall. They vary in thickness. Microcapsules are less than 0.2µm thick, and are too small to be easily detected under a light microscope with ordinary staining. Large capsules are larger than 0.2µm thick. they bind tightly to the cell wall and are easily visible under a microscope. Most capsules are made of polysaccharides, but some are made of polypeptides. The capsule plays a part in protection, immune evasion, adhesion, biofilm formation, preventing dessication, retaining nutrients, and virulence. </li>
            <li>Spore: It is an irregularly shaped oval body that forms in the bacterium, due to unfavourable conditions, and has multiples layers with low permeability. It is also highly resistant to extreme conditions, such as heat, UV radiation, chemicals, and desiccation. However, it can only be produced by gram-positive bacteria. It has the essentials for the bacterium to survive, until conditions are right again.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Archaea</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Cell Wall: It is similar to the cell walls in bacteria cells, except that archaea lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls, but are made up of pseudopeptidoglycan, made up of N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, or other polysaccharides and proteins. Some archaea do not possess a cell wall.</li>
            <li>Cell Membrane: It is quite similar to the cell membrane in bacteria cells, but there are key features that make it unique. Firstly, its glycerol backbone exists in L-isomeric form, causing the orientation of the hydroxyl groups to mirror those of the D-form, which corresponds to the L-formation. Another key difference, especially from bacteria, is the use of ether bonds (-COC-) instead of ester bonds, between the glycerol and side chain. The bonds make them more resistant to harsh conditions, and help to make the membrane stable. Last of the prominent differences are the isoprenoid chains instead of fatty acids in the phospholipids. The chains also branch out sideways. Common types of isoprenoid chains include phytanyl.</li>
            <li>Cytoplasm: Similar to all other cells, the cytoplasm is the gel-like substance where cellular activities take place, and where other cellular structures can be found.</li>
            <li>Ribosomes: It is 70S in size, and made up of to subunits, 30S and 50S in size, both characteristics like bacteria, however it is more similar to eukaryotes in function and structure. Their archaeal ribosomal rRNA contains sections more similar to eukaryotic rRNA, making archaea important in understanding the link between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. They have a different shape when compared to bacterial ribosomes, and are made of ribosomal proteins unique to archaea, though they do contain some ribosomal proteins that are found in bacteria. Ribosomal proteins are structural and functional parts of the ribosome. They work together with rRNA (ribosomal RNA) to form the small and large ssubunits that make up the ribosome. The proteins help with the stabilisation of the structure and assist in the translation process, for example helping to ensure the correct alignment of mRNA (messenger RNA) and tRNA (transfer RNA). Ribosomal proteins are made by first transcribing genes that encode ribosomal proteins in DNA into mRNA. The mRNA is then translated by existing ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Hence, they are synthesized like all other proteins by ribosomes. After which, the proteins are transferred to the ribosome assembly site, to combine with rRNA to form a ribosome. Archaeal ribosomes also are resistant to many antibiotics that affect bacteria, due to their structural differences. Same as all other ribosomes, archaeal ribosomes translate mRNA into proteins by catalyzing the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids.</li>
            <li>Plasmids: It is similar to bacteria in its general structure and function, playing a role in gene transfer. They transfer genetic material the same as bacteria, through one of the three ways: conjugation, transformation, transduction.</li>
            <li>Cytoplasmic inclusion granules: Similar to bacteria in structure and function, but some types have unique features. In halophilic archaea, they aid in osmoregulation, similar to bacteria, by storing potassium salts. For thermophilic bacteria, they have special metabolites stored to stabilise proteins at high temperatures. In sulfur-metabolising bacteria archaea, similar to bacteria, store energy or redox reactions. Some also store lipids for later use in membrane formation or as an energy store.</li>
            <li>Nucleoid: Similar to bacteria, archaea do not have a nucleus like eukaryotes, instead the nucleoid contains the genetic material. Similar to bacteria, they also have a single circular chromosome, with similar benefits and function. </li>
